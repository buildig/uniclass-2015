# Uniclass 2015 classification in CSV format

Uniclass 2015 is a unified classification for the construction industry. Uniclass 2015 is divided into a set of tables which can be used to categorize information for costing, briefing, CAD layering, etc. as well as when preparing specifications or other production documents.

These tables are also suitable for buildings and other assets in use, and maintaining asset management and facilities management information.

[Buildig](http://buildig.com/) converted Uniclass 2015 classification tables into CSV format and [packaged as a versioned snapshot](https://github.com/buildig/uniclass-2015/releases) for easier usage in a software development process. Converting script is located at [/util/convert.sh](/util/convert.sh) (requires [in2csv](http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.2/scripts/in2csv.html)).
